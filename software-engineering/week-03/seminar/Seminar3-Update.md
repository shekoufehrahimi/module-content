  - [ ] GitHub project for coursework created.

## Activity

Firstly, in your groups decide who is facilitating the  meeting today.

#### 1. Purpose

You should aim for a single sentance for the purpose of the format...

'The purpose of this application is to provide a platform where...'

You can then add detail with some 'how can we...' questions. Use the wishes that you have identified in your personas to formulate these questions.

__How can we... questions__

Three or four 'how can we...' questions should cover the purposes of your project. Questions in this format are often used by designers. _They are useful becuase they focus on the problem that needs solving rather than jump into a solution too early on._

Example:

(For case study - coffee shop rating site)

1. How can we help people find good coffee shops in a particular town?
2. How can we enable keen coffee drinkers to rate coffee shops?
3. How can we enable coffee drinkers keep track of coffee shops they have visited before?

#### 2. Personas and Scenarios

Using personas and scenarios is a way that you can explore your user needs.  This exercise will help you reach a *shared understanding* of the purpose of your application, the context in which people will use it, and a high level view of the functions it should have.  

Later you can build on this understanding of user NEEDS to extract the features and requirements, and express these more formally.

During your agile development methodology, you can return to these Personas to help you think about changed requirements.

Build at least two personas / scenarios as per this article:

https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/personas  

(See the example tab)

Once you have done this, you will be better able to formulate a short statement of the purpose.

#### 3. Outline tasks

These should be generic at this point. Look ahead in the programme schedule and get a sense of the shape of the project.  Use your task board.

 * Write user stories
 * Create wireframes
 * Testing/evaluation plan 
... etc
