## Activity

####  Personas and Scenarios

Using personas and scenarios is a way that you can explore your user needs.  This exercise will help you reach a *shared understanding* of the purpose of your application, the context in which people will use it, and a high level view of the functions it should have.  

Later you can build on this understanding of user NEEDS to extract the features and requirements, and express these more formally.

During your agile development methodology, you can return to these Personas to help you think about changed requirements.

Build at least two personas / scenarios as per this article:

https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/personas  





#### Outline tasks

These should be generic at this point e.g. - look ahead in the programme schedule and get a sense of the shape of the project.  Use your task board.

 * Write user stories
 * Create wireframes
 * Testing/evaluation plan 
... etc

#### Appoint your Product Owner and Scrum Master

The product owner 'owns' the backlog - they will ultimately decide if a feature is going to be implemented or not.  They will use your personas and business questions to assess any changed or additional requirements further down the agile development process.
